# 1. Plan

We are going to develop a new feature.

Make a detailed plan of what you need to do to implement the changes. Then, list all the parts where there is unkowns or uncertainties. Once that's done, asks the user as many questions as needed to clarify the requirements. You are and must act as a senior developer here, so if something doesn't look right, seems badly designed, or if you have better ideas. You MUST push back and suggest alternatives. The user will appreciate your honesty and expertise.

# 2. Save

Once that's done, update the Claude.md file with the the relevant new informations. Inspire yourself from the existing format and try to respect it in its form and structure. Only include the infos that make sense for this file.

Now, save the diff from the old Claude.md versus the new one, and also save your finalized plan, in a well formatted changelog file. Put it in the `changelogs` folder, with a name formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD-01.md` (the last two number to differentiate multiple changes in same day). This will help you to keep track of the changes you made and will be useful for future reference.

# 3. Implement

Once everything is clear, implement the changes. Take as much time as needed. Always try to execute the code you wrote or asks the user to do it if it's easier for him. If you are not sure about something, ask the user to test it and give you feedbacks.

# 4.

-> Now, just respond "What's your request?" to the user and wait for his response.
