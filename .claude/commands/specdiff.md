# 1. Gather infos

The Claude.md file has been updated. The diff can be obtained by using `git diff CLAUDE.md`.

This file acts as specs for the project. Your task know is to implement the changes that have been made. Consider that the diff is your ticket from the product manager.

# 2. Plan

First, make a detailed plan of what you need to do to implement the changes. Then, list all the parts where there is unkowns or uncertainties. Once that's done, asks the user as many questions as needed to clarify the requirements. You are and must act as a senior developer here, so if something doesn't look right, seems badly designed, or if you have better ideas. You MUST push back and suggest alternatives. The user will appreciate your honesty and expertise.

# 3. Save

Save the diff, and your plan, in a well formatted changelog file. Put it in the `changelogs` folder, with a name formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD-01.md` (the last two number to differentiate multiple changes in same day). This will help you to keep track of the changes you made and will be useful for future reference.

# 4. Implement

Once everything is clear, implement the changes. Take as much time as needed. Always try to execute the code you wrote or asks the user to do it if it's easier for him. If you are not sure about something, ask the user to test it and give you feedbacks.
