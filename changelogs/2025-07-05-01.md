# Extract Cards from Resource Feature Implementation
**Date:** 2025-07-05  
**Feature:** AI-powered card generation from resource sections

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive feature to extract educational flashcards from resource sections using a two-step AI process. The feature includes a complete user interface for previewing and editing cards before saving them to the database.

## Plan

### Architecture
- **Two-step AI Process**: 
  1. Extract Q&A pairs in markdown from resource content
  2. Convert Q&A pairs to structured flashcards with fake answers
- **Preview Interface**: Editable cards interface with add/remove/edit capabilities
- **User Flow**: Section → Generate Cards → Preview/Edit → Save to Database

### Technical Implementation
- **Card Schemas**: Zod validation for type safety
- **AI Integration**: Uses existing AI provider system with logging
- **Database**: Stores cards with JSON variants in existing structure
- **Components**: Reusable card editing components

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

#### Core Schemas & Types
- `web/lib/card-schemas.ts` - Zod schemas for card validation
- `web/lib/db/cards.ts` - Database helpers for card operations

#### AI Service
- `web/services/ai-card-extractor.ts` - Two-step AI extraction process

#### Server Actions
- `web/app/resources/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/actions.tsx` - Generate and save card actions

#### UI Components
- `web/components/cards/CardVariantEditor.tsx` - Individual variant editor
- `web/components/cards/EditableCard.tsx` - Complete card editor
- `web/components/cards/CardsPreview.tsx` - Full preview interface
- `web/components/cards/GenerateCardsButton.tsx` - Generate trigger button

#### Pages
- `web/app/resources/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/cards/preview/page.tsx` - Cards preview page

### Files Modified
- `web/app/resources/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/page.tsx` - Added generate cards button

## Features

### AI Card Generation
- **Context-Aware**: AI sees full resource content for better context
- **Two-Step Process**: Q&A extraction followed by structured card creation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All AI inputs/outputs logged for debugging
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation ensures data integrity

### Card Types Supported
- **Classic Cards**: Question/answer with optional fake answers for quizzes
- **Text Cards**: Long-form content broken into memorizable parts
- **Bidirectional**: Support for reverse variants (e.g., "Capital of France?" → "Paris" + "Paris is capital of?" → "France")

### User Interface
- **Generate Button**: Prominent button on section page
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during AI processing
- **Preview Interface**: Full editing capabilities before saving
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation

### Editor Features
- **Add/Remove Cards**: Dynamic card management
- **Edit Variants**: Full control over card variants
- **Fake Answers**: Add/remove fake answers for quiz mode
- **Text Parts**: Break long text into memorizable chunks
- **Live Preview**: See cards as they will appear in the app

## User Flow

1. **Section Page**: User views a resource section
2. **Generate**: Click "Generate Cards" button
3. **AI Processing**: Two-step AI extraction with loading state
4. **Preview**: Navigate to editable cards interface
5. **Edit**: Modify questions, answers, fake answers as needed
6. **Save**: Cards stored in database, redirect to section

## Technical Considerations

### Type Safety
- Uses simplified card types (string-based) instead of mobile's complex CardBlocks
- Full Zod validation throughout the pipeline
- TypeScript inference from schemas

### AI Integration
- Leverages existing AI provider system
- Configurable prompts for different extraction strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Database Design
- Uses existing cards table structure
- JSON storage for flexible variant types
- UUID generation for card IDs

### Performance
- Async processing with proper loading states
- Client-side editing without server roundtrips
- Efficient database transactions

## CLAUDE.md Updates

### Added Instructions
- Card generation is now available through section pages
- Two-step AI process for educational content extraction
- Preview and editing workflow before database storage
- Comprehensive logging for AI debugging

### Architecture Updates
- Documented card schema structure
- AI card extraction service integration
- Preview interface workflow

This implementation provides a complete, user-friendly solution for generating educational flashcards from resource content using AI, with full editorial control before saving to the database.
