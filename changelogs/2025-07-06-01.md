# Card Schema Migration & New Card Types Implementation
**Date:** 2025-07-06  
**Feature:** Complete migration to new card schema with 4 card types

## Summary

Completely migrated the card system from the old simple string-based schema to a new comprehensive array-based schema supporting 4 different card types for enhanced learning experiences.

## Card Schema Changes

### **Old Schema → New Schema**
- **Fields**: `string` → `string[]` (all text fields now arrays)
- **Types**: `"classic"/"text"` → `"single_response"/"unordered_list"/"split_sentence"/"numbered_list"`
- **New Features**: 
  - `more_infos` field for additional context
  - `fakeAnswersPerPosition` for position-specific fake answers
  - Complex fake answer structures

### **New Card Types**
1. **`single_response`**: Simple Q&A pairs (e.g., "What is the capital of France?" → "Paris")
2. **`unordered_list`**: Multiple answers where order doesn't matter (e.g., greenhouse gases)
3. **`split_sentence`**: Memorize sentences/quotes word by word (e.g., famous declarations)
4. **`numbered_list`**: Ordered sequences for step-by-step learning (e.g., scientific method)

## Technical Implementation

### **Core Utilities Created**
- **`ArrayFieldEditor.tsx`**: Dynamic string array management with add/remove/reorder
- **`FakeAnswersEditor.tsx`**: Handle both simple and per-position fake answers
- **Type-safe architecture**: Full Zod validation for all card structures

### **AI System Updates**
- **Enhanced prompts**: Detailed examples for all 4 card types
- **Smart type selection**: AI chooses appropriate card type based on content
- **Complex structure support**: Handles arrays and nested fake answer structures

### **Component Architecture**
- **`CardVariantEditor.tsx`**: Complete rewrite supporting all 4 types with type switching
- **Dynamic UI**: Adapts interface based on selected card type
- **Per-position fake answers**: Advanced UI for ordered card types

## Example Card Structures

### Single Response
```json
{
  "type": "single_response",
  "question": ["What is the capital of Australia?"],
  "answer": ["Canberra"],
  "fakeAnswers": [["Sydney"], ["Melbourne"], ["Perth"], ["Brisbane"]],
  "more_infos": ["Canberra became capital in 1908 as compromise."]
}
```

### Split Sentence
```json
{
  "type": "split_sentence",
  "question": ["Recite the Universal Declaration opening"],
  "answer": ["All human beings", "are born free", "and equal", "in dignity", "and rights."],
  "fakeAnswersPerPosition": [
    [["All humans"], ["All people"], ["All men"]],
    [["become free"], ["are free"], ["are born equal"]],
    [["and similar"], ["and identical"], ["and alike"]],
    [["in value"], ["in importance"], ["in honor"]],
    [["and duties."], ["and freedom."], ["and justice."]]
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified/Created

### **New Utility Components**
- `web/components/cards/ArrayFieldEditor.tsx` - Dynamic array management
- `web/components/cards/FakeAnswersEditor.tsx` - Fake answers handling

### **Updated Core Components**
- `web/components/cards/CardVariantEditor.tsx` - Complete rewrite for 4 types
- `web/services/ai-card-extractor.ts` - Updated AI prompts with examples

### **Schema & Types**
- `web/lib/card-schemas.ts` - New comprehensive schema (updated by user)

## Breaking Changes

- **No backward compatibility**: Old card format no longer supported
- **All text fields are arrays**: Question, answer, fakeAnswers, more_infos
- **New validation rules**: Zod schemas enforce array structures
- **Different fake answer formats**: Simple vs per-position based on card type

## User Experience

### **Enhanced Editing**
- **Type switching**: Convert between card types while preserving content
- **Array management**: Intuitive add/remove/reorder for all text fields
- **Contextual UI**: Interface adapts based on selected card type
- **Per-position fake answers**: Advanced editing for ordered sequences

### **AI Generation**
- **Smarter type selection**: AI chooses optimal card type for content
- **Rich examples**: Comprehensive prompts with real-world examples
- **Complex structures**: Supports advanced fake answer configurations

## Technical Considerations

### **Performance**
- **Dynamic rendering**: Components efficiently handle type switching
- **Array optimization**: Minimal re-renders during array operations
- **Validation**: Real-time Zod validation prevents invalid states

### **Type Safety**
- **Full TypeScript coverage**: All new structures properly typed
- **Zod integration**: Runtime validation matches TypeScript types
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures

## Next Steps (In Progress)

1. **Update EditableCard and CardsPreview** - Adapt to new schema
2. **Create display components** - Section page card displays
3. **Update section page** - Handle new card types in viewing
4. **Complete testing** - Validate entire generation → edit → save flow

This migration enables much richer educational content creation with specialized card types for different learning scenarios while maintaining type safety and excellent user experience.
