# Card Schema Refactoring - 2025-07-06

## Major Changes

### Schema Updates
- **UnorderedListCardVariant**: Changed `answer` field to `answers` (plural) for consistency
- **OrderedListCardVariant**: Simplified structure - removed `fakeAnswersPerPosition` and restructured to use `answers: {answer: string[], fakeAnswers?: string[][]}[]`
- **All card types**: Added new `level` field with enum values: "core_concept", "knowledge", "example"

### Database Changes
- Added `level` column to `cards` table with constraint and default value "knowledge"
- Migration: `2025-07-06.10-00.add-level-to-cards.ts`

### Component Updates
- **CardVariantEditor**: Updated to handle new `answers` array structure for both unordered and ordered list types
- **Display components**: Updated all card display components to work with new schema structure
- **EditableCard**: Added level selector and proper handling of level field
- **CardsPreview**: Updated validation logic for new schema structure

### AI Generation
- Updated AI prompts to include level field assignment
- Modified examples to show new schema structure with proper array formatting
- Enhanced card generation to intelligently assign importance levels

### Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `AnswerWithFakeAnswersEditor` component (functionality integrated into `CardVariantEditor`)
- Updated TypeScript types throughout the codebase
- Fixed all compilation errors from schema changes

### Breaking Changes
- **No backward compatibility** - old card format will display explicit errors
- `answer` field renamed to `answers` in UnorderedListCardVariant
- `fakeAnswersPerPosition` removed from OrderedListCardVariant
- New required `level` field for all cards

### Benefits
- Cleaner, more consistent schema across all card types
- Simplified fake answers structure for ordered lists
- Better categorization with importance levels
- More maintainable codebase with reduced component complexity
