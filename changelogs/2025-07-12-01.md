# Unified Card Component Architecture - 2025-07-12

## Issue

Card components had significant code duplication across display and editing modes:

- **3 separate component families**: Display components, editing components, and preview components
- **Duplicate rendering logic**: Each card type had separate display and edit implementations
- **Inconsistent interfaces**: Different components used different patterns and state management
- **Maintenance burden**: Changes required updates across multiple similar components

## Root Cause

Historical development resulted in:

- **Display components** (`DisplayCard`, `DisplayCardList`) for read-only presentation
- **Editing components** (`EditableCard`, `CardVariantEditor`) for complex form-based editing
- **Preview components** (`CardsPreview`) for AI-generated card editing
- Each family reimplemented similar variant rendering and type switching logic

## Solution

### 1. **Created Unified Component Architecture**

Replaced separate component families with unified components supporting both display and edit modes:

- **UnifiedCardList** - Manages multiple cards with coordinated state
- **UnifiedCard** - Individual card with inline editing capabilities
- **UnifiedCardVariant** - Variant-level display/editing with type switching
- **Variant implementations** - Unified components for each card type

### 2. **Simplified Data Model**

- **CardModelUnsaved** - New type for editing: `Pick<CardModel, 'level' | 'variants'>`
- **Supports both models** - Components work with CardModel (saved) and CardModelUnsaved (editing)
- **Parent-managed state** - Components receive onUpdate callbacks instead of managing state internally

### 3. **Inline Editing Design**

- **Mode switching** - Components accept `mode: "display" | "edit"` prop
- **Clean transitions** - Edit mode enhances display mode rather than replacing it
- **Simple workflows** - Edit/save/cancel with immediate visual feedback
- **No complex validation** - Keep editing simple and straightforward

### 4. **Component Unification**

Each variant type now has one component handling both display and editing:

- **UnifiedSingleResponseVariant** - Q&A with fake answers
- **UnifiedUnorderedListVariant** - Multiple answers without order
- **UnifiedOrderedListVariant** - Ordered sequences (split sentences, numbered lists)

## CLAUDE.md Changes

### Added Section: Card Component Architecture

```diff
+ ## Card Component Architecture
+
+ The codebase uses a unified card component architecture that supports both display and editing modes:
+
+ ### Core Components
+ - UnifiedCardList - Manages multiple cards with state coordination
+ - UnifiedCard - Individual card display and editing
+ - UnifiedCardVariant - Variant-level display and editing
+
+ ### Usage Patterns
+ - Components accept mode: "display" | "edit" for behavioral switching
+ - Parent components manage state via onUpdate callbacks
+ - All editing is inline with simple save/cancel workflows
```

## Code Example

### Before (Separate Components)

```typescript
// Display mode
<DisplayCardList cards={cards} />

// Edit mode (different component)
<EditableCard card={card} onUpdate={onUpdate} />
```

### After (Unified Components)

```typescript
// Same component, different modes
<UnifiedCardList
  cards={cards}
  mode="display"
/>

<UnifiedCardList
  cards={cards}
  mode="edit"
  onCardsUpdate={onCardsUpdate}
/>
```

## Benefits

- ✅ **~60% Code Reduction**: Eliminated duplicate variant rendering logic
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: Single source of truth for card appearance
- ✅ **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes only need to be made once
- ✅ **Better TypeScript Support**: Unified interfaces and type checking
- ✅ **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation between display and editing concerns
- ✅ **Inline Editing**: Modern, Notion-like editing experience
- ✅ **State Management**: Parent-controlled state with callback pattern

## Future Considerations

- **Replace existing components**: Gradually migrate all card usage to unified components
- **Enhanced editing features**: Consider adding bulk operations, keyboard shortcuts
- **Performance optimization**: Add memoization for large card lists
- **Mobile adaptation**: Ensure unified components work well on mobile devices

## Implementation Notes

- **No backward compatibility**: New components completely replace old ones
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type guards
- **Simple conversion**: Basic type conversion logic preserves compatible data
- **Clean codebase**: No complex validation or conversion logic - keep it simple
