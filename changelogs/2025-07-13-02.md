# 2025-07-13-02: Card Editing System Refactoring to Inline Editing

## Summary

Refactoring the card editing system from page-based batch editing to inline individual card editing to simplify the codebase and improve user experience.

## Changes Made to CLAUDE.md

### Admin User Flow Updates

- **Before**: "Preview and edit cards before saving to database"
- **After**: "Cards are generated and saved directly to database" + "Edit cards individually using inline editing on section page"

### Card Component Architecture Complete Rewrite

#### UnifiedCardList Changes

- **Before**:
  - Supports both CardModel[] and CardModelUnsaved[] arrays
  - Parent-managed state with onCardsUpdate callbacks
  - Accepts mode: "display" | "edit" prop
- **After**:
  - Accepts CardModel[] arrays only (no unsaved cards)
  - Receives action functions for card operations: onSaveCard, onUpdateCard, onDeleteCard
  - Includes "Add New Card" functionality
  - No mode prop - always displays cards with editing capabilities when action functions provided

#### UnifiedCard Changes

- **Before**: Inline editing with save/cancel workflow via parent mode management
- **After**:
  - Internal edit state management (each card can toggle edit mode independently)
  - Edit/Save/Cancel buttons when action functions are available
  - Save button positioned at top of card beside delete button

#### Usage Patterns Complete Rewrite

- **Before**:
  - Components accept mode: "display" | "edit" for behavioral switching
  - Parent components manage state via onUpdate callbacks
- **After**:
  - Individual cards can switch to edit mode independently
  - Each card operation (save/update/delete) is handled individually with immediate database persistence
  - New cards are created in edit mode and only saved to database when user clicks save
  - Simple alert() error handling for failed operations
  - No complex state management or batch operations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simplify Section Edit Page

- Remove all card-related logic and state management from edit/page.tsx
- Remove card-related actions from edit/actions.tsx
- Keep only section metadata editing (title, content, more_content)

### Phase 2: Update UnifiedCardList Component

- Remove `mode` and `emptyMessage` props
- Add action function props: onSaveCard, onUpdateCard, onDeleteCard
- Add "Add New Card" button with local state for new card creation
- Default empty message: "No cards yet. Click 'Add New Card' to get started."

### Phase 3: Update UnifiedCard Component

- Add internal `isEditing` state
- Add edit/save/cancel buttons when action functions are provided
- Position save button at top beside delete button
- Handle individual save operations with error handling

### Phase 4: Update Section Display Page

- Add card action functions that make individual API calls
- Pass action functions to UnifiedCardList
- Add simple alert() error handling
- Remove "Edit Section" button for cards (keep for section metadata)

## Files to Modify

1. `web/app/resources/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/page.tsx` - Add card actions
2. `web/app/resources/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/edit/page.tsx` - Remove card logic
3. `web/app/resources/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/edit/actions.tsx` - Remove card actions
4. `web/components/cards/unified-card-list.tsx` - New interface & add card button
5. `web/components/cards/unified-card.tsx` - Individual edit mode

## Key Design Decisions

- **Individual vs Batch Operations**: Move from batch editing to individual card operations for simplicity
- **Immediate Persistence**: Each card save/update/delete writes to database immediately
- **Simple Error Handling**: Use alert() for errors instead of complex toast systems
- **No Card Reordering**: Order is not important, simplifying the interface
- **Edit Mode per Card**: Each card manages its own edit state instead of page-level mode switching
- **Action Functions Pattern**: Pass specific action functions instead of generic callbacks

## Benefits

- **Simpler Codebase**: Removes complex state management from edit page
- **Better UX**: Users can edit cards directly where they see them
- **Individual Operations**: No risk of losing all changes if one card fails to save
- **Clearer Separation**: Section editing vs card editing are completely separate
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see changes saved immediately

## Technical Notes

- Cards Preview Page already updated (no changes needed)
- New cards only created in database when user clicks save
- Save button positioned at top of card for better visibility
- Default empty message eliminates need for custom empty messages
- Simple alert() error handling keeps complexity low
