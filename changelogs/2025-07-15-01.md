# Resource Publishing System - 2025-07-15-01

## Summary

Added a publishing system to control resource visibility to end users. Resources now have a published state that determines whether they appear in the mobile app and public-facing APIs.

## Changes Made

### Database Schema

- Added `published_at` column to the `resources` table (nullable timestamp)
- Created migration: `2025-07-15.10-00.add-published-at-to-resources.ts`
- New resources are unpublished by default (`published_at = null`)

### API Updates

- Updated `api/domains/resources/getList.ts` to filter only published resources
- Updated `api/domains/my/homepage.ts` to filter only published resources
- Added filtering condition: `where("published_at", "is not", null)`

### Web Admin Interface

- Added publish/unpublish buttons to resource detail page (`/resources/[id]`)
- Added published status badges to both:
  - Resource list page (`/resources`)
  - Individual resource page (`/resources/[id]`)
- Added published date display on resource detail page
- Created server actions for publish/unpublish operations in `web/app/resources/[id]/actions.tsx`
- Added database methods: `publishResource()` and `unpublishResource()` in `web/lib/db/resources.ts`

### Publishing Logic

- **Published**: `published_at` contains a timestamp
- **Unpublished**: `published_at` is null
- Admin dashboard shows all resources regardless of status
- End-user APIs only return published resources
- No changes needed in mobile app code (automatically filtered by API)

## Files Modified

### Database

- `api/migrations/2025-07-15.10-00.add-published-at-to-resources.ts` (new)
- `shared/src/database.d.ts` (auto-generated)

### API

- `api/domains/resources/getList.ts`
- `api/domains/my/homepage.ts`

### Web Admin

- `web/app/resources/[id]/actions.tsx` (new)
- `web/app/resources/[id]/page.tsx`
- `web/app/resources/page.tsx`
- `web/lib/db/resources.ts`

### Documentation

- `CLAUDE.md` - Added publishing system documentation

## Technical Details

The publishing system uses a simple timestamp-based approach:

- When a resource is published, `published_at` is set to the current timestamp
- When unpublished, `published_at` is set to null
- API queries filter using `where("published_at", "is not", null)`

This approach provides both the published state and the publication timestamp for potential future features like "recently published" or publication history.

## Migration Required

Run the following commands to apply the database changes:

```bash
yarn migrate-all
yarn codegen
```
