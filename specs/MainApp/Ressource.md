# Cases

- Author / channel ?

  - When somebody create content, there is only two possible cases:
    1. It's original content / Its own content
       -> In that case there should be a page like a youtube channel page with all its video. Subscription system and recommendation from that channel.
    2. It's a repost from another platform, from somebody else than original author
       -> In that case, the content should be linked to the original author and the original content. The original author should be able to claim the content and get the credit for it.
