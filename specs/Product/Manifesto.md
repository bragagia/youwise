YouWise, a thousand books in your hand, a thousand books in your head.

In yesterday world, access to knowledge was scarce and expensive. Today, it is abundant and cheap, so much that we are drowning in it.
Yet we are retaining almost nothing. We are consuming more than ever, but we are not learning.

Goal :

- Transform knowledge consumption into retention
- Make learning addictive
